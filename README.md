# GPX Photo Map
Synchronizes photos with a GPX track based on their time stamp, then creates a Google Map with thumbnail markers for each photo to see where exactly they were taken.

See examples at [velebny.net](https://photos.velebny.net/)

## Notes
- To display the resulting Google Map on your website, you will need to provide your own [Google Maps API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)

## TODO
- Create an installer
